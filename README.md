# StochasticPocessesA2
This repo will contain code for the second problem set of Stochastic Processes: the fundamentals. All is in a ipynb.

Note! The code uses parallel computing for the simulations because I like detailed graphs. However, this is now set to 22 CPUs. Running on a system with less CPUs will take tremendous long or might cause a crash. So decrease the number of iterations
